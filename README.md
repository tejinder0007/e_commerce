## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  * **Node.js**: [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which includes npm).
  * **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **Yarn**: (npm comes with Node.js, for Yarn: `npm install -g yarn`)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    cd [your-project-folder]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

2.  The application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Context API Usage

The application leverages React's Context API for efficient state management across components:

  * **`AuthContext.jsx`**: Manages user authentication state (e.g., login status, user data). Components can consume this context to conditionally render content or fetch user-specific data.
  * **`CartContext.jsx`**: Manages the state of the shopping cart (e.g., items in cart, total price). Components like `ProductDetail` and `CartPage` interact with this context to update and display cart information.

Both contexts are provided at the `RootLayout` level, making them available to all pages and components within the application.

-----

## Routing

The application uses `react-router-dom` for navigation, setting up the following routes:

  * `/`: **Home page** - Displays the product listing (`ProductListingPage`).
  * `/products/:id`: **Product Detail page** - Shows details for a specific product, where `:id` is the product identifier (`ProductDetail`).
  * `/cart`: **Shopping Cart page** - Displays items currently in the cart (`CartPage`).
  * `/checkout`: **Checkout page** - Guides the user through the purchase process (`CheckoutPage`).
  * `/login`: **Login page** - Allows existing users to sign in (`LoginPage`).
  * `/register`: **Register page** - Allows new users to create an account (`RegisterPage`).
  * `/profile`: **User Profile page** - Displays user-specific information (`ProfilePage`).
  * `*` (catch-all): **Not Found page** - Redirects to `NotFoundPage` for any unmatched routes.

All routes are nested under a `RootLayout` which ensures the `Navbar` and context providers (`AuthProvider`, `CartProvider`) are present on all relevant pages.

-----

## Available Pages

  * **`ProductListingPage`**: Displays all available products.
  * **`ProductDetail`**: Shows detailed information for a selected product.
  * **`CartPage`**: Manages the user's shopping cart.
  * **`CheckoutPage`**: Handles the final purchase process.
  * **`LoginPage`**: User login interface.
  * **`RegisterPage`**: User registration interface.
  * **`ProfilePage`**: User's personal profile.
  * **`NotFoundPage`**: Custom 404 page for invalid URLs.
